# Gallery of My Life

## Description

I will be creating a gallery page to share pictures of things that I love, and that are important to me. Visitors who take a visit to my page will be able to click on the images provided to view a description and choose to click a "like" button if they so desire. I will be using Axios to retrieve GET data from /gallery and I will be storing my data in App.js. I will be creating a new component for the GalleryList and this is where I will be passing the gallery stored data via PROPS.
